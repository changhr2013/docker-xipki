    |
    +-- UPDATEME (file, required for first time and on every change)
    |     If present, it indicates that content of this folder is changed.
    |     - If the CRL will be downloaded, this file will be created
    |       automatically when the download has been finished;
    |     - Otherwise this file must be created via other method.
    |
    +-- REMOVEME (file, optional)
    |     Indicates that the CA shall be removed from the database.
    |
    +-- REVOCATION (file, optional)
    |     If present, it specifies the revocation information of the CA.
    |     An example file is in the folder template.
    |     If there are multiple CRLs for the same CA certificate, only one of
    |     the REVOCATION file of revoked CA certificate will be considered.
    |
    +-- ca.crt (file, required)
    |     CA certificate. Either DER or PEM encoded.
    |
    +-- ca.crl (file, optional)
    |     DER encoded CRL file.
    |     - Will be ignored if the CA is revoked, otherwise required.
    |
    +-- issuer.crt (file, required for indirect CRL)
    |     If present, it specifies the CRL's issuer certificate.
    |
    +-- crl.url (file, optional)
    |     - If present, contains a line of the URL of the CRL.
    |     - It will be used to construct the CrlID in the OCSP response.
    |
    +-- certs (directory, optional)
        Contains all certificates that are valid at current time
        (notBefore <= current <= notAfter).
        Either the DER or PEM encoded raw certificate in a file with
        suffix crt, der or pem, or the heximal serial numbers in the
        file with suffix serials. Each crt-file contains exact one
        certificate, and each serials-file contains multiple serial
        numbers, one per line.

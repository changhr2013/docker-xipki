    |     If present, force to update of CRL immediately.

    |
    |-- tls-trustanchor.pem (file, optional)
    |     File that contains the trust anchor certificates for the
    |     TLS connection to download the CRLs.
    |
    +-- certs (directory, optional)
        Contains all certificates that are valid at current time
        (notBefore <= current <= notAfter).
        Either the DER or PEM encoded raw certificate in a file with
        suffix crt, der or pem, or the heximal serial numbers in the
        file with suffix serials. Each crt-file contains exact one
        certificate, and each serials-file contains multiple serial
        numbers, one per line.
